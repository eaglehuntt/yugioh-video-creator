The moment an effect threatens to wipe out a card on the field, Stardust Dragon can Tribute itself to shut it down, negating the activation and destroying the source. But it doesnâ€™t stay gone for long. if its effect goes through, it returns from the Graveyard at the end of the turn, ready to protect your field all over again. Reliable, reactive, and hard to keep down, Stardust Dragon is the definition of a defensive ace."]
